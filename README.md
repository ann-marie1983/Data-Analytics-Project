Project plan
Firstly I will complete a data cleanse by replacing missing values and/or dropping duplicates. 
Secondly I will reorganise the dat by sorting, indexing, grouping information. 
Thirdly, where needed I will Loop iterrows and Merge dataframes if necessary.
When reviewing the data and understanding my needs I will create reusable code in Python while also using code funtions from Numpy. 
Dictionary or Lists. 
Then based on insights gained I will use five Matplotlib charts to display five different insights I have gained from the data.
